postgresql-14 (14.4-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.

    + Prevent possible corruption of indexes created or rebuilt with the
      CONCURRENTLY option (√Ålvaro Herrera)

      An optimization added in v14 caused CREATE INDEX ... CONCURRENTLY and
      REINDEX ... CONCURRENTLY to sometimes miss indexing rows that were
      updated during the index build.  Revert that optimization. It is
      recommended that any indexes made with the CONCURRENTLY option be
      rebuilt after installing this update.  (Alternatively, rebuild them
      without CONCURRENTLY.)

postgresql-14 (14.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.

    * Confine additional operations within security restricted operation
      sandboxes (Sergey Shinderuk, Noah Misch)

      Autovacuum, CLUSTER, CREATE INDEX, REINDEX, REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW,
      and pg_amcheck activated the security restricted operation protection
      mechanism too late, or even not at all in some code paths. A user having
      permission to create non-temporary objects within a database could
      define an object that would execute arbitrary SQL code with superuser
      permissions the next time that autovacuum processed the object, or that
      some superuser ran one of the affected commands against it.

      The PostgreSQL Project thanks Alexander Lakhin for reporting this
      problem. (CVE-2022-1552)

    * Fix default signature length for gist_ltree_ops indexes
      (Tomas Vondra, Alexander Korotkov)

      The default signature length (hash size) for GiST indexes on ltree
      columns was accidentally changed while upgrading that operator class to
      support operator class parameters. If any operations had been done on
      such an index without first upgrading the ltree extension to version
      1.2, they were done assuming that the signature length was 28 bytes
      rather than the intended 8.  This means it is very likely that such
      indexes are now corrupt.  For safety we recommend re-indexing all GiST
      indexes on ltree columns after installing this update.  (Note that GiST
      indexes on ltree[] columns, that is arrays of ltree, are not affected.)

postgresql-14 (14.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.

    + Make the server and libpq reject extraneous data after an SSL or GSS
      encryption handshake (Tom Lane)

      A man-in-the-middle with the ability to inject data into the TCP
      connection could stuff some cleartext data into the start of a
      supposedly encryption-protected database session.

      This could be abused to send faked SQL commands to the server, although
      that would only work if the server did not demand any authentication
      data.  (However, a server relying on SSL certificate authentication
      might well not do so.) (CVE-2021-23214)

      This could probably be abused to inject faked responses to the client's
      first few queries, although other details of libpq's behavior make that
      harder than it sounds.  A different line of attack is to exfiltrate the
      client's password, or other sensitive data that might be sent early in
      the session.  That has been shown to be possible with a server
      vulnerable to CVE-2021-23214. (CVE-2021-23222)

      The PostgreSQL Project thanks Jacob Champion for reporting these
      problems.
